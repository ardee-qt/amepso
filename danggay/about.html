        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <div class="section-grid">
          <article>
            <p>
              <strong>Founded on November 15, 1948</strong>, Roxas was created as an independent municipality from Mansalay
              through Executive Order No. 181 by President Elpidio Quirino. It was named after President Manuel Acuña Roxas,
              who passed away on April 15, 1948, making Roxas the first town named in his honor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally known as Paclasan, the municipality comprises 20 barangays across a land area of 8,526 hectares.
              Located 126 kilometers from Calapan, Roxas developed as a major port due to its strategic position along the Tablas Strait.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2003, the Strong Republic Nautical Highway (SNRH) was inaugurated, opening the Port of Roxas in Barangay Dangay.
              This transformed Roxas into a transit hub connecting to Boracay, Romblon, and Palawan, bolstering tourism and international trade.
